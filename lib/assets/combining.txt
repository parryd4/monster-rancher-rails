INTRODUCTION
--------------
The original Monster Rancher, known as Monster Farm in Japan, was an
innovative game created by Tecmo where the idea was to raise monsters on a
ranch. To get these monsters, almost any CD (data CD, game CD, or music CD,
though the game couldn't read DVD format) could be put into your Playstation
and, by reading the data on the disk, a monster would be created for you to
raise. Simple enough, no? Well, not exactly. You, as the breeder, had to
decide what to feed your monster, what sort of training to put them in, when
they can go on errantries (essentially a four week training camp), and when to
finally put them through fights in order to raise their rank. As the trainer,
you also had the chance to go on expeditions and enter specific tournaments in
order to open up new and hidden monsters. And once your monsters had finally
lived a long and productive life, they could be frozen away in order to
combine with one another, creating stronger and stronger monsters with which
to continue the legacy. Eventually, the idea was to get your monsters to
become the next champion of the arena.

In the second game, Monster Rancher 2, they went and did it again; the game
has the same sort of idea as Monster Rancher 1, but with more of everything.
More monsters, more foods, more battles, more secrets. This has thrown this
game into the level of a cult classic, giving people a great amount of
entertainment for the money value. The replay value is infinite; there are
simply too many things to strive toward in this game. Certainly the basic idea
is to get a monster to the Big 4, but there are so many other goals that you
can reach for. Unlock all the rares. Try to completely max a monster out. See
if you can get all the monster cards. Master combinations. Or just make a run
on the final battles again and again and again. 


WHY THE WALKTHROUGH/FAQ?
------------------------
Combining is one of my favorite parts of Monster Rancher 2. It's an enormous
challenge to see just what sort of starting stats that I can come up with in a
combination, and just how good a baby monster I can make. However, combining
is an extremely complicated subject. Sure, it's easy to put monster 1 and
monster 2 together for monster 3, but there's an enormous amount of work that
needs to go into doing it if you want the baby to turn out to be a fantastic
piece of work.

Certainly, I could have added this entire FAQ as a section in my Walkthrough.
However, due to the number of entries, the intricacy, the complexity, and the
sheer detail I'm hoping to offer in it, I thought that giving it its own
separate FAQ would be the best idea.

+ COMBINING +
+=+=+=+=+=+=+


1) COMBINING BASICS
-------------------
If you want to take combining down to the most basic level, it's taking one
Monster Rancher monster and combining it with a second to make a third. This
third monster, ideally, should have higher stats than either parent did at
birth, more moves than the average newly-created monster's two, and is
generally a cross between the two parents' species.

Sounds fairly simple, doesn't it? And at that most basic of levels, it is.
However, the actual act of combining is a lot more complicated than that. 

Many people will have had this happen: they take what they thought were two
ideally-raised creatures and put them together, and all the stats come out
fairly low. Sure, the baby might have several moves, and a small boost on
stats is better than none, but what in the world happened to those awesome
numbers that you'd hoped would cross over? Or even when they manage to get
Dadge to proclaim 'This is a great combo!', and yet when the combination
happens, the baby pops out not looking much better than your last 'It's all up
to you.' combo. Or maybe the opposite has happened. The prospect is unsure,
yet when the two are combined, one stat comes out at an absolutely
unbelievable level. 

Well, this Combining FAQ will help explain what's going on in the situation,
as well as giving you some hints for how to create your own perfect
combinations out of almost any monsters. A process I tend to call 'genetic
engineering' or just 'engineering', for obvious reasons. 


2) WHAT DADGE SAYS
------------------
When you bring your monsters in and prepare to combine them, Dadge will always
make a comment about the combination. Only the order of the statistics is
taken into account, however; it has nothing to do with the two monsters' types
or their movelists. If you could somehow get a Monol and a Pixie to have the
same line of stats, even though they're as different as night and day, they'll
be considered a 'great' (mind you, this example is an impossibility, but more
on that later). 

No stats match OR monsters are identical breed: 'This one's all up to you'

One stat matches: 'The prospect is unsure'

Two stats match: 'This combination doesn't look so good, I can't recommend it'

Three stats match: 'The prospect is fine... It will probably work out'

Four stats match: 'The prospect of this combination is good. You can look
forward to it.'

All six stats match: 'The prospect of this combination is great. It can't go
wrong unless something weird happens.' 

Now, the best way to get a 'great' combination is to take two of the same (or
very similar) monster, raise their stats up in the same way, and then combine
them. The baby you will get out of this combination will often be a 'great'
combination, and as you might gather from the wording on a 'great'
combination, the baby will almost always have fairly high stats, if not
amazingly high ones. However, this isn't always the case. 

Say you wanted to get yourself a Suezo/Pixie, because you thought the Pink Eye
would look awesome (hey; some people like pink!), and the stats it would gain
would make it a spectacular creature for your high-int, high-skill style. You
raised up a Pixie and Suezo in the exact same way, with both of them having
the exact same following stats: Lif: 350, Pow: 500, Int: 500, Ski: 400,
Spd: 800, and Def: 300. You bring them in to Dadge. And yet, even though the
numbers are the _exact_ same, he reports: 'The prospect is unsure.'

Wait a minute, you say. Both Pixie and Suezo are intelligence-skill creatures
with low life and defense, and yet when the stats are the _exact same_, Dadge
reports the combination as the second worst of the bunch. What's going on
here?

This is where a situation comes in that has been termed 'correcting'. It's
where certain stats are either considered higher or lower than their actual
on-the-screen number. 

Confused? Read on.


3) CORRECTING
-------------
The stats you see on the monster's sheet are not the 'precise' numbers that
the game looks at when it comes down to combination. Rather, they're used as a
'base', while the numbers get 'corrected' by the monster's stat gains.
Depending on the level of stat-gain, the monster's numbers are multiplied by a
specific amount:

1 = 0 (it's multiplied by 0, thus making it 0 no matter what)
2 = .5 (or, for ease of bookkeeping, divided by 2)
3 = 1 (the number stays the same)
4 = 1.5 (the number gets half again added on to it)
5 = 2 (double the number)

In the set of numbers, 999 is the highest it can go. So if a multiplier would
push it over 999, assume the number is 999 and no higher. 

So, we take our example creatures once again: Lif: 350, Pow: 500, Int: 500,
Ski: 400, Spd: 800, Def: 300. Now, let's instead apply those numbers by
monster, rather than just looking at them in the base. 

Pixie: 1/2/5/4/4/1
Lif: 350 x 0 = 0
Pow: 300 x .5 = 150
Int: 500 x 2 = 999
Ski: 400 x 1.5 = 600
Spd: 800 x 1.5 = 999
Def: 300 x 0 = 0

Suezo: 2/3/5/4/2/2
Lif: 350 x .5 = 175
Pow: 300 x 1 = 300
Int: 500 x 2 = 999
Ski: 400 x 1.5 = 600
Spd: 800 x .5 = 400
Def: 300 x .5 = 150

So as you can see, once correcting's been done with both these monsters, the
numbers are enormously different. Clearly, they're nowhere near a good
combination by that.

But wait. There are a few areas where the numbers are exactly the same in the
pixie's lineup. Lif/Def are both at 0, and Int/Spd are both at 999. So how
does the game calculate which one is higher? 

This is where the monster's baseline stats come in.


4) TIE-BREAKING
---------------
Each monster in the game has a specific set of stats that it starts out with.
They are different for each monster, but for that specific monster-type,
they're exactly the same every single time. These numbers are then modified by
bonus numbers from CDs or by bonuses from combining, but if you combine any
monster down far enough, the stats will eventually show the very bottom-line.
These stats are called 'baseline'. 

A monster's baseline stats are extremely important in combining for two
reasons. One reason, I will get into later. For now, though, I'm more focused
on the first and more immediate reason: breaking ties. If the monster has two
numbers that are exactly the same (usually because it hit 999 or 0, though
there's occasional rare times that the number is simply exactly the same after
being corrected), the baseline stats will tell you in which order the
monster's stats are to be considered.

Again, let's take our present example: the corrected pixie. Its stats, when
corrected, are as follows: 0/150/999/600/999/0

A pixie's baseline stats, as you'll be able to see in the chart below, is
Lif: 50, Pow: 80, Int: 170, Ski: 150, Spd: 140, and Def: 60. From this, we can
see that Intelligence is higher than Speed, and that Defense is higher than
Life. So for the monster's stats, we can look at it this way: Lif: 0 (50),
Pow: 150, Int: 999 (170), Ski: 600, Spd: 999 (140), Def: 0 (60). Which makes
the order of stats on our pixie a very solid Int, Spd, Ski, Pow, Def, Lif. 

So, what we have is a pair of monsters who line up like this:

Pixie | Suezo
------+------
INT   | INT
SPD   | SKI
SKI   | POW
POW   | SPD
DEF   | LIF
LIF   | DEF

In other words, they only have one stat which lines up, thus Dadge's
'uncertain'. The baby will very likely get an excellent intelligence, but the
rest of the stats aren't going to be anywhere near as good. Such a pity. 

Now. We've decided that we want that pixie to be part of the combination
because it will give us good stats all the way down the board, and it has more
moves than the Suezo. So, let's raise us another Suezo to be able to more
closely-match the Pixie's numbers. Since the Suezo has no gains of 1 in
anything, we can pretty much force it to match the Pixie's numbers, just as
long as we're willing to push for stats that might not want to be raised high
normally. In the end, after some blood, sweat, and tears, we come up with the
final monster: Lif: 300, Pow: 250, Int: 750, Ski: 300, Spd: 950, Def: 350.
Although the numbers look nothing like those of the Pixie's, when we apply
correcting...

Suezo: 2/3/5/4/2/2
Lif: 300 x .5 = 150
Pow: 250 x 1 = 250
Int: 750 x 2 = 999
Ski: 300 x 1.5 = 450
Spd: 950 x .5 = 475
Def: 350 x .5 = 175

... we end up with a monster whose stats are in this order: Int, Spd, Ski,
Pow, Def, Lif. And if you'll measure that up to the Pixie...

Pixie | Suezo
------+------
INT   | INT
SPD   | SPD
SKI   | SKI
POW   | POW
DEF   | DEF
LIF   | LIF

... Dadge says 'Great combo'! Congratulations. You've now got a great
combination.

Now comes the next step, actually putting the two monsters together. Eagerly,
you watch as lights flash and sparks whirl, and out comes a Suezo/Pixie, just
like you'd wanted! Eagerly you check its stats...

.... and find out that while Intelligence is indeed high, the rest of the
monster's statistics aren't all that great. Well, wait a minute, here! Dadge
said that as long as nothing goes wrong, it should be a great combo.
Obviously, something went wrong. But what?

Once again, we turn to those baseline stats. Because now, they're going to
have a completely different use, though a similar one: stat-order.


5) STAT-ORDER
-------------
When monsters are combined, the parents' numbers are taken and bonuses are
applied to the baby's baseline numbers. However, those numbers are penalized
if the parents' stats aren't in line with the baby's baseline stats, or given
bonuses if they're exactly there. The exact numbers for this aren't known (and
indeed, randomness has been observed), but the additions you can get are quite
considerable in some cases, giving the baby stats of 500-600 right off the
bat!

Basically, the bigger stat-gains are reserved for babies whose baseline stats
are as similar as possible to the parents. So let's look at the example we've
got here and find out where our screw up happened.

A Suezo/Pixie's baseline stats are as follows: Lif: 80, Pow: 120, Int: 170,
Ski: 130, Spd: 100, Def: 90. That puts their order as Int, Ski, Pow, Spd, Def,
Lif. Compare that to the stat-order of the parents above...

Parent | Baby
-------+------
INT    | INT
SPD    | Ski
SKI    | POW
POW    | SPD
DEF    | DEF
LIF    | LIF

... and you'll notice that the only place the numbers match up are the very
first one (there's why your baby has such an incredible intelligence!) and in
the last two (too far down the chart to give you good bonuses in them; you're
likely to get only a few points above baseline even if you did have the stats
to spare). 

Now you're frustrated. You don't want to waste all those great stats on a baby
whose numbers aren't all that great. You'd rather throw away this Pink Eye and
try for it again later. So what will you do with the parents instead?

Well, check out what Dadge has in his lineup for the monsters. You'll notice
that there's a number of creatures in the list rather than just the Pink Eye.
There's also a Vanity (Pixie/Suezo), a Pixie (Pixie/Pixie), and a Suezo
(Suezo/Suezo). Going down the chart below, you pick out each of those monsters
and compare their baseline stats with what you have:

Parent|Pinkeye|Vanity|Suezo|Pixie
------+-------+------+-----+-----
INT   | INT   | INT  | INT | INT
SPD   | Ski   | Ski  | Ski | Ski
SKI   | POW   | SPD  | POW | SPD
POW   | SPD   | POW  | DEF | POW
DEF   | DEF   | DEF  | LIF | DEF
LIF   | LIF   | LIF  | SPD | LIF

Making comparisons, the one most likely to get good numbers is either the
Pixie or the Vanity. Unfortunately, due to how high the speed is, there's not
going to be any way to salvage this 'great' into something really superior.
You'll have to take the good stats from one of those two combinations and work
on it from there.

Frustrating, I know. But when it comes to randomly raising numbers, there's
generally a good chance that you won't be able to get exactly what you want.
You'll just have to lean toward the 'next best thing'. However, you're set in
your decision. You're frustrated. You _want_ that Pink Eye and you want it to
be good. So what do you do?

A little thing I call 'genetic engineering'.


6) GENETIC ENGINEERING
----------------------
The very first thing you need to know when genetic engineering is what you're
going for. In this case, we'll continue with our example: you want that darned
Pink Eye. Check what its baseline stat order is. For the Pink Eye, because of
our earlier checking, we know that it's got the order of
Int/Ski/Pow/Spd/Def/Lif. Now that we know this, let's check out the parents'
stat-gains as well as their baseline stat order. There is a reason for this,
which I will be pointing out very soon.

Suezo's stat gains are 2/3/5/4/2/2. Baseline stat order is
Int/Ski/Pow/Def/Lif/Spd. Not the same as the Pink Eye, but that's OK. By
looking at the stat gain, we'll notice that there isn't a single '1' in the
bunch. This is very important to engineering, as we'll see very soon.

Pixies' gains are 1/2/5/4/4/1. Notice here that we have two stat gains that
are at '1'. Because of this, there'll be two stats that are dropped
automatically to 0, no matter how high we raise them. Because of that, there
is a danger that we may not be able to get their stats in line with the baby
at all, depending on what those numbers default to. If the order was Lif/Def,
for example, then you would never be able to get the order into Def/Lif. The
numbers would still be good, but there'd be no 'great'. Fortunately, their
baseline stat order is Int/Ski/Spd/Pow/Def/Lif, though. This means we can
commence with the engineering.

We'll take the Suezo first, since its stats are closer to the Pink Eye. Now,
we have to carefully raise all its stats so it stays in exact line with those
all-important baseline stats. Not horribly hard at first; because of the fact
that intelligence is #1, we can safely max out intelligence if you want. Skill
is #2 in both of them, so again: feel free to max out your skill; just make
certain that it's lower than intelligence at all times (not too hard with the
correcting 'double' that you'll be getting in intelligence). Likewise with
Power; make sure it's lower than skill. Of the last three, all you have to do
is ensure that Speed is higher than Defense, which is higher than Life. 

By the end of it, we'll say we have our Suezo's numbers up to Lif: 300,
Pow: 550, Int: 900, Ski: 900, Spd: 450, Def: 350. Correcting them:

Lif: 300 x .5 = 150
Pow: 550 x 1 = 550
Int: 900 x 2 = 999 (170)
Ski: 900 x 1.5 = 999 (130)
Spd: 450 x .5 = 225
Def: 350 x .5 = 175

... we get an order of Int, Ski, Pow, Spd, Def, Lif. The exact lineup we need
for our Pink Eye.

Half-way done, now, we pull out the Pixie. Here, things are going to be a
little more difficult, though. The Pixie's gain of 4 in speed and 2 in power
means that we're going to have to work all the harder at getting the numbers
accurate. While we can max out both skill and intelligence as with the Suezo,
those two will have to be more strictly enforced: make certain that your power
is always higher, *after* correcting, than what your speed is. Otherwise, the
correcting will come in and make a hash of things, throwing you right back
down to 'Not such a good combo'. Keep a calculator on-hand if you need help
with the numbers. And remember: you can raise your Defense and Life as high as
you want; because of them correcting to 0, you'll get a great combo even if
both of them are at 999. In addition, by having high numbers, you can probably
give the baby a boost here. So if you don't want to spend time raising other
stats for fear of getting your important numbers out of line, raise defense
and life all you want.

Let's say that we worked that Pixie into the ground, and now we've got the
final product: Lif: 300, Pow: 800, Int: 900, Ski: 900, Spd: 250, Def: 350.
Corrections are applied:

Lif: 300 x 0 = 0 (50)
Pow: 800 x .5 = 400
Int: 900 x 2 = 999 (170)
Ski: 900 x 1.5 = 999 (150)
Spd: 250 x 1.5 = 375
Def: 350 x 0 = 0 (60)

... and we have Int, Ski, Pow, Spd, Def, Lif. The combo is a great. And in
addition, take a look:

Parent | Baby
-------+------
INT    | INT
Ski    | Ski
POW    | POW
SPD    | SPD
DEF    | DEF
LIF    | LIF

Everything lines up! The stat carryover for this combination will be *much*
bigger than it would have been if you'd just done the more 'random
combination'. Congratulations. You've now used genetic engineering to make
yourself the 'perfect' monster.

There are two other types of engineering that I use. Each of them is slightly
more complicated than the next. The first one we'll look at is 'reverse
engineering'. 


7) REVERSE ENGINEERING
----------------------
Let's say that you still have that one Suezo in your stable. The one that you
'messed up' while trying to make the original Pink Eye. We'll say you managed
to get a gold peach with your new Pink Eye, fed it to the Suezo, and therefore
managed to get some more life out of it. So you decide to take it out and
raise it up a little more, making a moneymaker out of it. By the end of it
all, you have a Suezo with the following stats: Lif: 350, Pow: 700, Int: 500,
Ski: 400, Spd: 800, and Def: 400. Not too bad, you think. But now that I have
it, what do I do with it? 

Here's where reverse engineering comes in. First thing you do is to take those
stats and correct them, so you know what you're looking at. In this case,
we're looking at:

Lif: 350 x .5 = 175
Pow: 700 x 1 = 700
Int: 500 x 2 = 999
Ski: 500 x 1.5 = 750
Spd: 800 x .5 = 400
Def: 400 x .5 = 200

Or Int, Ski, Pow, Spd, Def, Lif.

Now that you have that information, take that line of numbers and compare them
with the other monsters. You'll find that two different monsters match this
line of numbers: the Pink Eye (Suezo/Pixie) and the Horn (Suezo/Tiger). Since
we've already raised a Pink Eye, let's go with the assumption that you'd
rather raise the Horn. 

Now that you have the monster that you want to create, you've already got one
parent whose stats are perfectly in line to make it. Stick that Suezo away.
Now, check the chart again. The easiest way to do this would be a Tiger,
obviously; Suezo+Tiger=Suezo/Tiger, after all. However! Before you shrine that
Tiger, take a look at its stats:

Gain: 2/2/4/5/4/1

Here, we have a problem. Because of the gain of 1 in defense, defense will
always be the lowest (0 is lower than anything else, after all). But our final
monster has *life* as the lowest number. This could go two ways. First off,
you could simply use the Tiger after all and not worry too much about two
stats out of alignment: you'll still get superior numbers up in the important
range. 

However, we're assuming that you want to make a 'great' combination no matter
what. So let's scan down the list of Tiger/<sub> breeds. Rather than reproduce
them all here, we'll just assume you're going down the list and... oh, lookie
here: 

Tiger/Golem: 2/3/4/3/3/3

Here, we have a Tiger cross that not only has it easy to get Life as the
lowest number, but has average gains pretty much down the line, making it
fairly easy to balance out the other stats as needed. This'll be ideal for our
use as a combiner. Just remember to check the baseline stats, so you know
where to avoid maxing the monster out:

Tiger/Golem: Lif: 80, Pow: 100, Int: 140, Ski: 110, Spd: 130, Def: 120

... or Int, Spd, Def, Ski, Pow, Lif.

So, if you want to raise the Tiger/Golem completely in line with this Suezo,
then maxing out Intelligence, Skill, and Power are alright. The rest, keep
lower than those three, and keep them in order where you can. 

So we'll say after a lot of work, you've got the following: Lif: 800,
Pow: 950, Int: 950, Ski: 999, Spd: 650, Def: 450. We correct...

Lif: 800 x .5 = 400
Pow: 950 x 1 = 950
Int: 950 x 1.5 = 999 (140)
Ski: 999 x 1 = 999 (110)
Spd: 650 x 1 = 650
Def: 450 x 1 = 450

.... or Int, Ski, Pow, Spd, Def, Lif. 

Taking those to Dadge, the combination will be a 'great'! And if you'll take a
look here...

Parent | Baby
-------+------
INT    | INT
Ski    | Ski
POW    | POW
SPD    | SPD
DEF    | DEF
LIF    | LIF

... the stat carryover, once more, will be considerable.


8) SUB-ENGINEERING
------------------
Every now and then, there is a monster that it seems absolutely impossible to
be able to engineer a 'great' combo for. Generally this is because it has
stats that don't line up with any other monster, you just plain haven't got
the monster that would be needed for the perfect engineering, or that every
other monster in line with it are so far off the number that it's impossible
to create. This can also occur if you're trying to make a 'great' combo off a
monster you already have (reverse engineering), and the only monsters you find
aren't even remotely like what you have created. For these occasions, I do
what I tend to call 'sub engineering'. 

Let's take a fairly extreme example: you want to engineer a Dragon/Kato for
that awesome 'feline dragon' look they have. Dragon/Katos have a baseline of
Lif: 100, Pow: 140, Int: 160, Ski: 120, Spd: 130, and Defense: 110. In other
words: Int, Pow, Spd, Ski, Def, Lif. So of course, you turn to the listings to
examine the base numbers of the two most obvious parents:

Dragon/Dragon: 3/5/5/3/2/3
Kato/Kato: 2/1/5/3/5/2

Uh oh. Already, there's an obvious problem. Dragons get gains of '5' in power,
where Katos have a '1'. Plus, that 1 in power means that we're not going to be
able to get the numbers properly balanced. Obviously, there's no way that a
great combination could be made with these two creatures in mind.

.... or can it?

When the monsters are this far apart, just raising them directly from the
primary monster type can be difficult, if not impossible. So instead of that,
let's start looking at the various monsters with a Dragon or a Kato *sub* to
them. 

First off, let's take a look at the Dragon/Kato's baselines: Int, Power,
Speed, Skill, Defense, Life. So we do some comparisons of that. There's
nothing that matches up with that exactly, so we'll have to lean toward stat
gains to be able to engineer the parents to match up. However, there's that
pesky need for high speed as well as the high power: something that dragons
don't get. Likewise, Katos don't get good gains in power no matter what
they've got crossed with them, aside from Dragon (and we're assuming you don't
have that available, for obvious reasons). 

First off, for our Dragon side, let's select a Mocchi/Dragon. They have many
good gains in stats, and, most importantly, they've got an average gain in
speed, thus leaving the ability to raise speed fairly high without crippling
it. Raise this the same way you would any engineered monster: keep its stats
in line with what the baby's baseline stats will end up being. Thanks to the
Mocchi gains, this won't be too difficult.

For the Kato, things will be more difficult: you need to find something that
raises power quite well to be able to keep up. Again, none of the Kato
primary-breeds do well in power, so we'll instead take a look at the various
subs. For this, we'll consider the Baku/Kato to be one of the best choices:
its skill is a little lower than what's comfortable, but with some hard
number-raising, it's certainly within the realm of the 'possible'. 

Obviously, getting the combination out of the smaller percentage is a lot more
difficult when you do it this way. However, keep resetting and you'll
eventually get the one that you'd been looking for. 

Engineering subs can also be extremely useful if you haven't got a particular
'primary type' available for combination. Say you wanted to try and raise a
full-blooded Joker, but you didn't have any CDs that gave one at all. On the
other hand, you've got plenty of Selketo (Arrowhead/Joker), as many people
tend to have. Take two of those Selketo, engineer their stats to be in line
with the Joker, and then combine them down to get yourself a pure Joker with
excellent stats *and* really good starting moves. Another suggestion is, if
you don't mind an even smaller chance of getting what you want, make the
second monster in a breeding not even remotely related to it, but with stats
that are closer to being in-line. For example, combine your well-raised
Selketo with a Gali whose nearly-maxed stats are perfectly in-line for a
Joker. It'll take a long while to get your pure (even with disk chips) but the
stats will be worth it.


9) SOMETHING WRONG HERE...
--------------------------
So you followed the FAQ exactly, you got your monsters perfectly balanced, you
brought them to Dadge... and yet when it's all said and done, you still aren't
getting that 'Great' combination. Everything checks out, and yet something's
just not working? Is this FAQ stupid and useless? Are you just faking us
around, Kura?

In short, no. But there are still a few things at work that I (and no doubt
others) are working to figure out!

In long: a recent report by 'americanmimeboy' mentions that in at least a
couple cases, a monster's stats have deferred after correcting toward the
*raised* stats, rather than the *baseline* stats. After testing with a memory
card which was sent to me, I discovered to my shock and horror that this was,
indeed, the case: a tiger's corrected stats seemed to be 'preferring'
Intelligence over Speed, simply because the raised Intelligence was higher.
Lowering Intelligence or raising Speed immediately shifted it back to a
'Great'.

What this means is that there's still some strangeness at work, here. It may be
as simple as 'stats really *do* defer to the before-correction order', or as
complicated as.... well... something that's really complicated. Due to the fact
it'll take a lot of monsters and a lot of raising to test this (I have no
knowledge of hex code, so I have to do all my experiments manually), it'll be
some time before I can get a hypothesis on this for certain. However, it is
clear to say that if you have made a combination, and something didn't turn out
even after the calculations here suggested it should? Then please feel free to
mail about it! Keep on hand the monsters that you have, the stats that they
have, and if you are emulating, a copy of your memory card for me to take a
look at potentially. Hopefully, this little puzzle can be figured out and the
last piece (or two) of the big combining puzzle can be slotted into place!

Until that moment: if all calculations say that it should be a 'Great' combo,
and instead turns into a 'Good', see if you can't raise one of the offending
two corrected stats, or lower the other. See if that might correct it properly
to a 'Great'. If it does, let me know *that*, too!

Does this mean the rest of the FAQ is useless? Certainly not. The fact it took
this long for the issue to crop up to me suggests that it's not something that
is overly common to happen. And having been combining for over a year in the
past, with no issues, I'm willing to say that aside from the occasional 'blip',
the above combination calculations (and the below numbers) are still plenty to
get you well on your way while the last of the puzzle(s) is being figured out. 


10) IN CONCLUSION
----------------
As you can see, combining can certainly be a lot more complicated than simply
putting two monsters together and hoping they'll come out well (although
that's certainly a choice as well, for the purists). I can only hope the
information featured here will let you make monsters as good as you'd always
hoped you could make in combination.

Anyhow, here's the charts for the various monsters, both their baseline stats
and their stat-raising. Obviously this is necessary for knowing the
information on how they go: see the above for why.

* These stats have a 'tie' in them. This is, by all calculations otherwise,
supposedly impossible. This means that likely there is a miscalculation in the
numbers. The stat-order *should* be correct, but it may well not be for these
few. If you can find which of those numbers is higher than the other, let me
know. 

The rare monsters have not been added here, because unfortunately, the
baseline numbers haven't been found for them. If you can help with this, let
me know!

STILL TO COME
-------------
-- Hopefully the rest of the rares, both in stat-gains and in baseline stats.
-- Some odd results from one of my FAQ-users. I don't know how long it will
take to test it out and report any results, but it certainly gives me some
things to look over and try out. 


THANKS TO...
------------
Monster Rancher Metropolis (http://monsterrancher.com/) and its community of
researchers and players: The premier website for all things Monster Rancher. A
lot of the information on this walkthrough came directly from there (with
permission!). For more detailed, in-depth information about the game,
including some of the inner workings of how the monsters are read from CD and
various other statistics that these walkthroughs just couldn't hold, go here
and take a wander through. 

Lisa Shock: For allowing me to use some of the information found at the above
website to be able to fill out various details above. Your work in making the
website what it is is highly appreciated.

Dark Phoenix and Nevstar: For all their information on combining, correcting,
and how baselines come into it. If it wasn't for them, none of this would have
been possible. I'm simply explaining the information that they, themselves,
found out. All genuine credit should go to their hard work.

Corey Shenefield: For pointing out a rather large oversight in Dadge's list.

MysticSamuraiX: For giving me the baseline stats of the various DNA Capsule
monsters. These should be the same as the ones gotten from disk (although if
not, please feel free to send corrections).

Lord Carledo: For pointing out a typo/mistake in one of the charts.
Fortunately, nothing that threw the numbes off unduly, so I shouldn't get nasty
hate-mail from people having combining issues!

americanmimeboy: For mentioning his strange happenings to me, as well as
sending the memory card so I can fiddle around with it and see if the puzzle
can't be put together.
